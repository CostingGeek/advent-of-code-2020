# Advent of Code 2020
[adventofcode.com/2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

I chose **PHP** as this is the language I have most experience with. The code runs in [PHP Sandbox](https://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/)
